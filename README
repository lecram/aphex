NAME
       aphex - a lightweight cli hex editor


SYNOPSIS
       aphex [-h]

       aphex [-r] file...


DESCRIPTION
       Display HEX, ASCII and BINARY data of the given file and allow write through editing.


OPTIONS
       -h     Show keybinds and parameters.

       -r     Open file read-only.

CONTROLS
   Command and insert mode
       TAB
              Cycle through windows.


       Q
              Quit aphex.


   Command Mode
       i
              Enter insert mode, unless -r is given.


       0-9
              Write decimal offset to command buffer.


       ESC
              Clear command buffer (set to default 1).


       Nh, Nj, Nk, Nl
              Move cursor left/down/up/right by N lines/bytes where N is any integer in command buffer. If no N is explicitly given, the default value 1 is
              used.


       Ng
              Jump to decimal offset N where N is any integer in command buffer.


       0, $
              Jump to start/end of line.


       gg, G
              Jump to first/last line of file.


       q
              Redraw window after resize.


   Insert Mode
       ESC
              Enter command mode.

       ASCII window:


              BACKSPACE
                     Move cursor one byte back (across lines).



NOTES
       All changes made in insert mode are directly written to file. There is currently no undo function.

       In ASCII insert mode, forwarding is enabled. After every edit input, the cursor jumps to the next offset byte even across lines. This allows  direct
       text editing.

       You can use the movement keys in HEX insert mode.


EXAMPLES
       aphex -r .vimrc
              Open .vimrc in read-only mode.

       aphex .bashrc
              Open .bashrc for editing.
